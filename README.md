# 🏥 Health Insurance Claim Prediction – Datathon Project

## 📌 Problem Statement
The objective of this datathon was to predict the probability of a customer filing a health insurance claim using anonymized customer data.  
One of the main challenges was that claim cases are rare, making the dataset highly imbalanced.

The final goal was to build a model that can accurately rank customers based on their claim risk.

## 🧠 Approach
The project was developed and executed entirely on the Zerve AI datathon environment.

- Data understanding and exploration  
- Preprocessing and feature handling  
- Handling class imbalance  
- Model training using machine learning  
- Evaluation using AUC and Normalized Gini score
